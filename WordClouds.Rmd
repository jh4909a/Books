**“There's nothing like deep breaths after laughing that hard. Nothing in the world like a sore stomach for the right reasons.” **

― Stephen Chbosky, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower

## Summary
Charlie is a freshman.

And while he's not the biggest geek in the school, he is by no means popular. Shy, introspective, intelligent beyond his years yet socially awkward, he is a wallflower, caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it.

Charlie is attempting to navigate his way through uncharted territory: the world of first dates and mix tapes, family dramas and new friends; the world of sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, when all one requires is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite. But he can't stay on the sideline forever. Standing on the fringes of life offers a unique perspective. But there comes a time to see what it looks like from the dance floor.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a deeply affecting coming-of-age story that will spirit you back to those wild and poignant roller-coaster days known as growing up.

##Recent Tweets
This spiral graph shows when the tweets were sent out within the last seven days. Each circle represents a new day. Starting with the first tweet in the middle. R is day. T is hour of the day. The graph is similar to a clock, but based on the first tweet. The first tweet is the midnight of the clock. A tweet at 6 am on this clock is 6 hours after the first tweet was posted. 

```{r time spiral, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(lubridate)

DF = twListToDF(tweets_raw) 
# TO SAVE: 
write.csv(DF,file='wallflower_tweets.csv')

DF <- read.csv(file='wallflower_tweets.csv', sep=',', header=TRUE)
dtime <- rep(NA,nrow(DF))
for (i in 1:nrow(DF)) {
  dtime[i] = difftime(ymd_hms(DF$created[1]), ymd_hms(DF$created[i]), unit='days')
}
